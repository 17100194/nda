If you’re a professional, you’ll get a chance to win the prestigious <span style="font-weight: bold">Design Trophy</span>. Besides that, your name and work will be put up on our website and Facebook page for the entire year. You’ll be already famous before you come back next year! You would also earn bragging rights because your design was chosen by our highly esteemed jury (national and international experts of your category) amongst all other entries we receive from all over Pakistan. You’ll have a pretty cool portfolio to share with others. Plus adding this all to your resume, would definitely put you ahead of other candidates (including your friends that would already be jealous of your win!) while applying for jobs in the future and lead to greater career opportunities. At the very least, National Design Awards would enable you to get your ideas and perspectives across to experts in the design industry within Pakistan and abroad as well, which is a valuable opportunity that could bring you career changing insight on your work!</p>
